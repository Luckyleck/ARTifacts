## Map & Slider
We decided to use Leaflet to create our map. We found this library very beginner friendly and easy to navigate. This was crucial because of the time alotted for this feature. The countries are being rendered with a customized GeoJSON file.  

A user is able to click on any country of the map and slide the timeline to specific century. Then the fetch is made and the artwork is shown.

## Art Display
In our current version, the art display incldues the artwork and some information about it. This we deem crucial as it gives the artwork more context and value. A user can then favorite that art piece or go on to the next one.
